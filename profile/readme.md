# Why we are called Conscia

Conscia comes from the Latin word for ‘being conscious’ – understanding what matters, staying aware, and being someone people can continuously rely on.

But it’s more than just a name. It’s what drives everything we do and why we show up every day.

We are trusted experts who help businesses stay secure, connected, and ready for what’s next. We speak from experience in a way everyone can understand – from IT teams to the C-suite, and everyone in between. With the certainty of an expert, but with the warmth of someone who cares.

# Local insights, global reach

As part of the Conscia group, we combine leading European technical expertise with deep local insight. This gives you access to best-in-class resources and innovation from across Europe, delivered by a UK-based team that understands your environment and builds lasting relationships based on trust. 

We’re not a global company trying to understand UK nuances, and we’re not a local company without world-class resources. We’re the sweet spot! 

We work as part of your team, bringing strategic insight, proven experience, and additional capacity to help you meet today’s challenges and prepare for tomorrow’s opportunities. 

Whether you’re driving digital transformation, enhancing security, or scaling operations, we’re here to help you move forward – with the strength of a global group and the focus of a local partner.
